## PSM Stages and Activities

1. Analysis    
	- Solution requirement
	- Solution constraints
	- Scope of solution

2. Design    
    - Solution design
    - Evaluation criteria

3. Development
    - Manipulation (coding)
    - Validation
    - Testing
    - Documentation

4. Evaluation
    - Solution evaluation
    - Evaluation strategy

## PSM - Analysis

> [!todo]- Design brief
> A design brief is typically written during the analysis stage of the problem-solving methodology.

## PSM - Analysis - Solution requirement

> [!todo]- Solution requirements
> What the client needs from the solution in relation to its features.

> [!todo]- Solution requirements
> Solution requirements describe what a client needs from a solution; they are general rather than technical descriptions.


## PSM - Analysis - Solution constraints

> [!todo]- Constraint
> A restriction on what can and cannot occur in the creation of a software solution, external to the solution itself.

> [!todo]- Solution constraints
> Solution constraints limit or restrict solution requirements.

> [!todo]- Technical constraints
> Constraints related to the hardware and software available for the project.

> [!todo]- Non-technical constraints
> Limitations relating to areas other than hardware and software: social, legal and usability.


## PSM - Analysis - Solution scope

> [!todo]- Scope
> The boundaries or parameters of the solution â€“ what it will do and what it will not do.

> [!todo]- Scope of a solution
> The scope of a solution is the boundary or parameters of the solution that outlines what a program will do and what it will not do.

## PSM - Design - Solution Design


> [!todo]- Designs
> Designs can be represented using tools such as data dictionaries, object descriptions, mock-ups and pseudocode.

### Representing modules

> [!todo]- Data dictionary
> A set of information that describes elements within software, such as variables, data structures and objects. Data dictionaries are valuable as references when modifying code.

> [!todo]- Object description
> A way of describing all of the relevant properties, methods and events of an object.

> [!todo]- Mock-up
> A sketch showing how a screen or printout will look, used to aid in the design of an interface. Mock-ups are annotated visual representations of the user interfaces of software solutions.

> [!todo]- Pseudocode
> Pseudocode is a way of representing algorithms using structured English in a clear, human-readable, language-independent format.
