## Data structures


> [!todo]- Data structure
> A method of organising data to allow particular operations to be performed on them efficiently.

> [!todo]- ⭐Data structures
> Data structures are more complex than data types.

> [!todo]- Array
> A list of elements indexed by position. In most programming languages the first element has index zero.

> [!todo]- ⭐Arrays
> Arrays start at index value 0 in almost all programming languages.

> [!todo]- Array elements
> Arrays traditionally contain elements of the same data type, but this depends on the programming language selected.
